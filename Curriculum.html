<h2>Major projects</h2>
<p><b>Spring 2019: </b> Mobile application done in typescript for software analysis and modelling class. Done by team of 3. Role consisted in designing the UX guidelines and most of the frontend. Oversaw the progress using Agile methodology.</p>
    
<p><b>Spring 2019: </b> Collection of numerical methods algorithms implemented in Scilab. Objective of the project was to implement a user-friendly system to perform different mathematical calculations. The implementations of the project were later optimized.</p>
    
<p><b>Fall 2018: </b> Implementation of an object-relational database model using PostgreSQL. Done by team of 4. Role consisted in creating triggers, inserting mockup data and testing.</p>
    
<p><b>Fall 2018: </b> Implementation of Tensorflow object-recognition model in iOS using Tensorflow lite. Model was trained in collaboration by team of 5 people. Train and test data was group-sourced. Model implementation was done individually.</p>
    
<p><b>Summer 2018: </b> Alternative data-visualizers for EEG activity. Consisted of two separated projects. Brainremin, a sound translator for brainwaves done in python and Synethetoscopio, a visual artifact built in Processing with the idea of showing users’ brain activity changes when exposed to stimuli. Both data-visualizers were presented at Museo de Arte Contemporáneo de Monterrey (MARCO).</p>
    
<p><b>Summer 2018: </b>Videogame developed in Unity 2D. Consisted in a top-down game with shooting mechanics. Designed and programmed the core mechanics of the game in C#. Performed several tutorials in Unity 3D alongside.</p>
    
<p><b>Spring 2018: </b> Flight reservation system for databases course. Developed using HTML5, CSS, Javascript, PHP and MySQL. Collaborative project developed by team of 5. Elaborated part of the database structure design and developed front end using bootstrap.</p>
    
<p><b>Spring 2017: </b>Co-developed a simulator for an assembly line in C++. The purpose of the program was to emulate an assembly line and to output the position of the product being built taking into consideration the performance time of each machine involved in the line. Final project of object-oriented program class. Was a collaborative project.</p>
    
<p><b>Fall 2015: </b> Online platform for Model of United Nations. Consisted in developing an informative site for the event that high school was hosting. Only involved front end development using Foundation CSS and HTML5.</p>
